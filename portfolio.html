<h1> About me</h1>
<p> My name is Sarah Khazma. I've been teaching myself to code for the past year while continuing to work part time as a primary school teacher.
  Teaching my classes using Scratch opened my eyes to the beautiful, simple logic of programming.  From there, I taught myself (and the kids!) html and css.#
The more that I learned, the more that I fell in love with the juicy problem solving opportunities that I encountered, especially once I started
learning javascript!  

I've now taught myself a little of the following:


</p>
<div class = "section" id = "projects"></div>
<div class = "section" id = "contact"></div>
<script src = "i.js" type = "text/javascript">
